#Music-website-v2

Overhaul of 'Music-website,' redone from scratch with additional elements, considerations, and challenges, such as...

HTML: Contact form (no backend), table, built-in video and audio, SVG sprite map
CSS: Incorporation of 'normalize.css,' complementary colors in header, formatting without floats, em/% > px, non-default font
JS/jQ: Mediaelement.js
